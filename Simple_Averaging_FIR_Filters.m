% A low pass filter (LPF) is a filter that passes signals at a frequency 
% lower than a selected cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies 
% higher than the cutoff frequency. The exact frequency response of the filter 
% depends on the filter design. An ideal low-pass filter can be mathematically 
% (theoretically) implemented with a sinc function, multiplying a signal 
% by the rectangular function in the frequency domain or doubling with 
% the impulse response in the time domain. However, the ideal filter is 
% impossible to realize without infinitely large signals in time, and so 
% it often needs to be approximated for real ongoing signals, as the support 
% region of the sinc function extends to all past and future tenses. Therefore, 
% to perform conv, the filter must have infinite delay or infinite future 
% and past information.

% Real filters for real-time applications approach the ideal filter by truncating 
% and windowing the infinite impulse response to create a finite impulse response. 
% Applying this filter requires delaying the signal for a reasonable time interval, 
% allowing the computation to "look" into the future a bit (lagging). This delay 
% manifests itself as a phase shift. Higher accuracy in approximation requires a longer delay.

% In signal processing, the Nyquist frequency (or folding frequency), named 
% after Harry Nyquist, is a continuous function or property of a sampler that 
% converts a signal into a discrete sequence. The Nyquist frequency is half 
% the sampling rate of a discrete signal processing system.
% When the highest frequency (bandwidth) of a signal is less than the Nyquist 
% frequency of the sampler, the resulting discrete time sequence is said to be 
% free of distortion known as Aliasing. And the corresponding sampling rate is 
% said to be above the Nyquist rate for the signal.
