% The impulse-invariant method converts analog filter transfer functions to 
% digital filter transfer functions such that the impulse response is the 
% same (invariant) at sampling instants. The order of the filter is preserved 
% and IIR analog filters are mapped to IIR digital filters. However, 
% the frequency response of the digital filter is a version of the frequency 
% response of the analog filter, which is aliasing (an effect that causes 
% different signals to become indistinguishable when sampled).
% Because we were trying to digitize a higher order filter with an impulse 
% invariant transform, aliasing occurred during the conversion.

% Bilinear Transformation:
% [Ad,Bd,Cd,Dd] = bilinear(A,B,C,D,fs) It converts the continuous time state-space

% Bilinear transformation is a special conformal mapping used to convert a 
% transfer function H(s) of a linear time-invariant (LTI) filter in the 
% continuous time domain to a transfer function H(z) of a linear, shift-invariant 
% filter in the discrete time domain. method.
% Bilinear transform maintains stability and maps each point of the H(jŒ©) 
% frequency response of the continuous time filter to a corresponding point 
% in the frequency response of the discrete time filter, Hd (ùëí^jŒ©T), in despite of 
% with a slightly different frequency. This means that for every feature seen 
% in the frequency response of the analog filter, there is a corresponding 
% feature in the frequency response of the digital filter, perhaps at a slightly 
% different frequency, with the same gain and phase shift. This is barely noticeable 
% at low frequencies, but quite noticeable at frequencies close to the Nyquist frequency.
